//Kata: Function 2 - squaring an argument 
//Instructions: Now you have to write a function that takes an argument and returns the square of it. 

//No starter code for this one. 

//This is an insanely easy kata, the function is to be named square and it simply has to return the square of whatever number is passed into the argument

function square(n){ 
    return n**2
}

//I like the exponent operator in this situation
