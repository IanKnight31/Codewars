//Kata: Multiply, 8kyu
//Instructions
//This code does not exceute properly. Try to figure out why.

//Starter Code 

// function multiply(a, b){
//     a * b
//   }

//Everything looks good with the spelling and syntax, I believe that it is simply missing a return keyword, lets try.

function multiply(a, b){
    return a * b
  }

console.log(multiply(2,3)) //expected 6

//Indeed, 6 displays in the console.
