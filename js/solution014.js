//Kata: Grasshopper - Messi Goals
//Instructions: 
//Messi's Goal Total
// Use variables to find the sum of the goals Messi scored in 3 competitions

// Information
// Messi goal scoring statistics:

// Competition	Goals
// La Liga	43
// Champions League	10
// Copa del Rey	5
// Task
// Create these three variables and store the appropriate values using the table above:
// laLigaGoals
// championsLeagueGoals
// copaDelReyGoals
// Create a fourth variable named totalGoals that stores the sum of all of Messi's goals for this year.

//Starter Code 

// var laLigaGoals
// var championsLeagueGoals
// var copaDelReyGoals

// var totalGoals

//First things first we would probably change the var keyword to the let keyword 

let laLigaGoals = 43
let championsLeagueGoals = 10 
let copaDelReyGoals = 5 

let totalGoals = laLigaGoals + championsLeagueGoals + copaDelReyGoals

console.log (totalGoals)

//Indeed we simply add the goals together and store them in totalGoals
